# Cost/loss analysis for CME forecast properties

## Introduction

This repository provides an implementation of the Cost/Loss analysis in Python, as described by [Owens et al. (2020)](DOI).

## Installation
The ``Cost/Loss`` analysis is written in Python 3.7.3 and requires ``numpy``, ``matplotlib``, ``pandas`` and ``astropy``. All required data are included.

The simplest way to work with ``CostLoss`` in ``conda`` is to create its own environment. With the anaconda prompt, in the root directory of ``CostLoss``, this can be done as:
```
>>conda env create -f environment.yml
>>conda activate costloss
``` 
Then the examples can be accessed through 
```
>>jupyter lab code/CostLoss.ipynb
```
